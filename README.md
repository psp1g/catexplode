# Developing

Once you've cloned the repo and installed dependencies with `npm ci`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
